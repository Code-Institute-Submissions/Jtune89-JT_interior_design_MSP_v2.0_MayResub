Am I responsive shows that the site is responsive to different device sizes through utilising adaptive responsive code

Testing:

I have tested the site across different browsers and it works successfully on Chrome & Safari
I have confirmed that the site is responsive on different screen sizes using dev tools, and functions successfully
I have confirmed that the usability of the site is friendly to users and is readable
I have tested on lighthouse and achieved high scores across the reporting, with especially high scores in accessibility & best practices with 100 & 92 on the index page respectively.
I have also tested the HTML in the W3C validator and with only 2 issues highlighted (its saying there is a footer tag tat shouldn't be there but it should which is why it is)

Bugs:
Solved bugs: on the W3C validator it showed Alt tags missing for the logo which I have now resolved
when I deployed the code, I realised I had not put my main HTML file name as index.html so the deployed code was showing the readme file which needed to be amended and also required code changes.

Unsolved Bugs:
This W3C validator saying the footer tag should not be there - but it should so I have left it where it is
Lighthouse gave a score of 83 on SEO because a meta description is missing so I added it into the code, ran it again and it said the same thing
On the form I have no back end to submit the information to, I was going to steal the code institute one from the coffee house project however when you submit it, it shows code insitute and I thought it wouldn't look great so did not put an "action" into the form.

Validator testing:
HTML - bug mentioned above
CSS - no issues identified
Lighthouse scores:
82 performance
100 accessibility
92 best practice
83 SEO

Deployment:

The walkthrough video on the sample project for deployment is out of date and I had to spend some time trying to find the section to load the branch to main.
I had to do this activity a few times as mentioned with the index.html name change.
